## Stage 1: Foundations (Python I/O & String Handling)

**Objective:** Develop foundational Python scripts for security tool prerequisites: cleaning and standardizing user input (String Normalization), and handling persistent data (File Read/Write) for reports and logs.

## Stage 2: Cryptography (Cipher Implementation)

**Objective:** Developed scripts to implement both a classic cipher (Caesar) and a modern, secure cipher (Fernet/AES) to demonstrate secure data handling for sensitive information.
